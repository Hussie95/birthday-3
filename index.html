            <p>chachi tbh is the best person in my life. i can trust her with everything she’s the only person i talk to 
            everyday and i love talking to her. she’s so cute and beautiful but still she’s insecure sometimes that’s 
            the only bad thing about her baki she’s perfect and i love her - Daud</p>
            <p>chachi is my first and best friend on twitter, she's my closest friend and no one understands me as well as 
            she does, she knows everything about me from the things that make me happy to the ones that make me sad, she's 
            the best person ever and i love her sm, she's always there for everyone even when she's not doing well herself, 
            she's the most selfless person I know, she always goes above and beyond for her loved ones and would do anything 
            to make them happy and feel better at times when they're not doing well, I trust her the most, 
            she has the best heart and she's an absolutely amazing person - Husnain</p>
            <p>chachi probably is one of the closest friends of mine, she's so rude in gcs but she's so kind with
            me in dms, she always takes care of me asks me if i'm okay, i love this about her, she's so humble and nice,
            never thought i be praising her but i'm at gun point so - Ahmed</p>
