						Hiiii bestieee you've reached this far so congrats first of all. Now
						I know this was probably something you were not expecting and is
						most likely gonna be something that you won't be too happy about
						since it's related to your uni and I know this degree is something
						you never really wanted to do so you won't even feel like
						celebrating anything after reaching a milestone but it's okay if you
						don't, your bestie will for sure (meri duty hai 😤) okay jokes aside
						I know it has been really hard for you, I know you've sacrificed a
						lot, you've had to make tough decisions so that your siblings
						wouldn't have to go through what you have and like I know you would
						do anything but choose this degree, you're doing this just for your
						parents, your dad especially but hey, did you think one year would
						pass by this quick when you started? I don't think so, no one did,
						even I didn't, yes, I can probably not even iamgine how hard this
						year has been, you had so much to do, you had so much content to
						cover of everything, be it anatomy, chem, Bulgarian, Latin
						(medical), and other subs and then you have a place to take care of
						too, and all this while being away from your home and family makes
						it so much harder than it already is, it is a lot, I know you do
						brush it off sometimes as a no biggie but it really is a big deal,
						there's so many people out there who've been in similar situations
						who've been depressed and have destroyed their mental health cause
						of all this and I know you've had bad days too in between but one
						thing I'm really glad about is that you didn't give up no matter
						what, no matter how hard it felt like, you just continued and I'm
						seriously so proud of you, words can't describe how much, you've
						missed sm, You've missed being with your family on so many
						occasions, and that's incredibly hard, I can't even imagine. But as
						I always say, you're someone unlike anyone I've ever met. You're
						special and there's something about you that's different from anyone
						I've seen, it's the one thing that sets you apart from others like
						seriously, even as a person you always say that I am the best person
						when I believe it is you who actually is, you're literally perfect
						and there's literally no flaws in you, not any I can think of or
						see, you're the most caring, supportive, empathetic, kind, strongest
						and the prettiest person I've ever met (khush ho jao compliments
						hain,) you do sm for everyone, you're the most selfless person I
						know, I could literally just keep on complimenting and writing about
						how good of a person you are but let's get back to the point else I
						would be running out of space (sorry) You've completed your 1st year
						of meddd and this is huge like I'm literally so happy for you,
						congratsssssss!!!, I'm so so so proud of you, no doubt it has been
						hard, you've had your days, you had to pull all nighters but it's
						done, it's over, no more 1st year, it's done and dusted, well I know
						it has been over since a week or two now by the time you see this
						but I wanted to wait till the 17th, which is basically your last
						exam before you go home, I wanted that to end first and then
						surprise you with this so sorry for making you wait 😓 but anyways,
						you're done finallyyy with your 1st year Alhamdulilah, I'm sure your
						parents are super proud of you, you should be proud of yourself too
						like it really is a big deal, I know there's still a long way to go
						and a lot to do and this not being something you want to do does
						make it harder than it already is, but you've got this, In Sha Allah
						it'll be over before you know it, trust me, my prayers are always
						gonna be with you and I hope and pray you achieve everything you've
						dreamed of. I'll always try to be there by your side and I hope you
						know that I'm always here for you and you can literally share
						anything and everything at anytime, you're not alone. May Allah
						always keep you happy and may you get to do the things you've always
						wanted to, Ameen. I hope you like this not so big, not so much, but
						a little surprise from me, trust me you deserve way more than what
						I'm ever able to do for you. Now finally you'll get a well deserved
						break, make sure to make the most of it!!! I hope you have the best
						summer of your life. Congratssss once again bestie 🥳🩶. Love youuu
						🩶🩶
